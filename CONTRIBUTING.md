# Contributing to locales-check

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `locales-check`! We welcome external contributions but ask that you follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth collaboration process.

## Scope and Ideas for Features

- If you have a feature proposal, **please open an issue** first. Describe your idea clearly and wait for a concept acknowledgment from someone in the Moklabs organization before proceeding.
- Please note that **response times may vary**, as this is a side project that we work on during our spare time.
- Moklabs may decline feature proposals that fall outside the project’s scope or priorities. This ensures the long-term maintainability of the codebase, focusing on features actively used by Moklabs. If your idea doesn’t fit, you’re encouraged to fork the repository and bring your vision to life independently.

## Pull Requests
- Pull Requests (PRs) must:
  - Include appropriate tests for new features or changes. Contributions without tests may be rejected. 
  - Pass all tests. Please ensure the test suite runs without errors before submitting your PR.
  - Comply with linting standards. Resolve any warnings or errors reported by the linter to maintain code quality.

## Review Process

- All contributions will be thoroughly reviewed by a member of the Moklabs team to ensure quality and alignment with the project’s goals.
- All comments must be addressed, and the PR requires approval from a maintainer before it can be merged.
- Please be patient during the review process, as maintainers may need some time to provide feedback or approve your changes.
